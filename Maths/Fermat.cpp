//Fermat’s little theorem
//if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, the number a p – a is an integer multiple of p. 
//(10/5)%7 = 2%7=2
//(5/2)%7 =2.5 % 7 which is wrong so we find a p==(modular inverse of 2)
// (a/b)% M== (a* b^(M-2))% M
// p=b^(M-2);
//modular inverse of b= (b*p)% M=1;
// b is known so we have to just find p and p=b^(M-2);
